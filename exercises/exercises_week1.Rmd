## Exercise 1: Matrices


1. Create a matrix. The matrix should have 10 elements and 2 columns. All the elements of your matrix should be integers. Do not forget to give a name to your matrix.

```{r}
# Put your code in here

```

2. Create another matrix. The matrix should have 10 elements and 5 columns. All the elements of your matrix should be integers. Do not forget to give a name to your matrix.

```{r}
# Put your code in here

```

3. Multiply the two matrix together. Remember to use the right operator for matrix multiplication. Display the result.

```{r}
# Put your code in here

```

What happens if you use the standard multiplication operator?

4. Now create two square matrices and multiply them using the matrix multiplication operator and the normal operator. What do you notice?

```{r}
# Put your code in here

```


## Exercise 2: Systems of equations


1. Solve the following system

$$
\begin{cases} 5x - 2y + 3z - \alpha = 2  \\ 
x + 4y - z + \alpha = 19\\ 
4x + \frac{1}{2}y + 12z - 6 \alpha = -11\\
2x - y + z - 3 \alpha = -12
\end{cases}
$$

```{r}
# Put your code in here

```

Exercise 3: derivatives

1. What are the derivatives of the following functions:
  + $f(x) = cos(x)$
  + $f(x) = x + y^2$ for $x$ and for $y$
  + $f(x) = 5x + x^2 - e^x$

```{r}
# Put your code in here

```

2. Gradient. Use the `deriv` function to build the gradient of the following functions:
  + $f(x) = cos(x) - sin(x)$
  + $f(x) = 5x + x^2 + 5$
  + $f(x) = x^2 - ln(x) - 3x$

```{r}
# Put your code in here

```


Exercise 5: Probability

1. If there is 30 balls in an urn what is the probability of drawing any ball?
2. If 10 of those ball are red, what is the probability of drawing a red ball?
3. If the red balls are numbered 1 to 10 and the other balls (let's assume they are black) are numbered 1 to 10 with 2 black balls of each type:
  + what is the probability of the ball drawn being red if it is a 2?
  + What is the probability that the ball is marked with the number 7 if it is black?

4. If you throw a fair coin 10 times, what is the probability of getting exactly 4 heads? At least 4 heads?

5. If you roll a fair 6-sided dice 10 times, what is the probability of getting exactly 3 sixes? What is the probability of getting at least 3 sixes? 


Exercise 6: Some games with dice

You and one of your classmates got a number of dice. Now we need to come up with a game using them.

1. First, simulate each of the dice you have. Write a function that when called is going to select 1 of the faces of the dice.

```{r}
# Put your code in here

# In order to simulate a dice you could use the already available
# function called sample()

```


2. Now in discussion with one of your classmates, design a simple game were two players successively throw dice. Aim to make it fast, fun and allow for some strategic thinking. Once you have played this game a few times, calculate each players probability of winning. Do the final probabilities seem aligned with your perception when you played the game?
