## Challenge 1: The one with the pull request

Fork the [github repository](https://github.com/antoinevernet/BA1820) for the class.

Improve an existing slide in session 1 or session 2, or design a new slide that expand the current slide deck.

Edit the readme to add your name in the contributors section with your cohort name (Business Analytics 1617)

Write a pull request.

If your pull request is accepted (I might require some changes first), you win.



## Challenge 2: The one with the dice


Write a function that calculate probabilities for an arbitrary number of fair 6-sided dice.

Can you modify the function so it calculate probability for a fair dice with an arbitrary number of faces?

Simulate rolling a dice 1000 times to test whether your function produces the right results.
